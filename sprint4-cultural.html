                 <h2> Research Neuroplasticity </h2>
                <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people and how you might engage with those principles </h3>
                    <p> 
                        Whatever is happening around you, the way you experience life is wiring your brain. 
                        You are making connections within that context and the stories you tell yourself. 
                        Understanding neuroplasticity doesn’t mean that you ignore bad or uncomfortable things in your 
                        life and only focus on things that bring you joy, but that you take that understanding and apply it 
                        to how you interact and experience things. Your brain is constantly making new neural pathways. 
                        What does this mean? Your brain is not static. It is not fixed. You can learn something new, challenge old 
                        habits and basically ‘update’ your brain and change your mindset.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Having a better understanding of neuroplasticity means that I can achieve things that I thought were 
                        perhaps a bit out of reach. There are goals I would like to achieve, new things I’d like 
                        to learn and old habits I would like to break that I can apply this principle to. 
                        Knowing that I do not have to be ‘stuck’ in a way of thinking and that I can grow and learn means that I can 
                        achieve more than I thought I was capable of. It’s kinda like feeling like a kid again when you first start 
                        making friends, learning things and life is just good. I can carve out a new path if I want to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think engaging with mindfulness and meditation more regularly is one way that I can increase my neuroplasticity. 
                        Also just doing this course in general I am learning new things every day. But just knowing that it is 
                        possible to achieve this even if my trajectory is different than others I can still get there.

                <h2> Research Growth Mindset</h2>
                <h3>Discuss how and why growth mindset is relevant and how you will integrate the principles into your learning journey.</h3>
                     <p> Growth mindset is not about praising effort in general but praising efforts that lead to decision
                        making on next steps and how you will accomplish this problem/challenge. It is not about “well I tried” 
                        but more about “I tried and this didn’t work out so I tried a different way to see if I could get a new result”.

                        I studied piano from the age of 5 up until 15. Once I had finally moved into grade standard piano I had a 
                        wonderful teacher. Her approach to learning taught me a lot about how to problem solve in general. 
                        There were always the two components of playing - the theory and the performance. To understand how to count, 
                        pause, read, finger technique - a lot of that came from understanding the theory ( just like the basics you learn 
                        about how to write code, you can’t get very far if you don’t know what [h1] or [p] tags are). By understanding and 
                        applying theory to my practice, I had a better road map to perform a piece. When I was choosing my pieces for 
                        the year, she would play me a selection so that I could hear what I would be my final piece. We would then break 
                        it down into left hand, right hand, bars, keys, new techniques and each week I would be sent away to practice
                        one component over and over again and then come back the next week for my next assignment. By the time 4-6 
                        weeks were up of breaking down the entire thing I would get to play the piece together. 
                        That’s a real feeling of accomplishment when it is all finally there 
                        (until you have to go and memorise that shit - enjoy!).

                        There was one year in particular that I just wanted to quit out right but I didn’t. 
                        Mastering anything is hard but with practice, patience and perseverance you can. Going back on 
                        this time in my life definitely makes me realise that I do have the ability to go forward and persevere 
                        in this field of study even though I feel like I am losing my brain a little bit at this current moment. 
                        I can apply the same learning techniques of looking at the bigger picture and then breaking it all down 
                        into smaller bits that will help me achieve the outcomes I need to in this course.
