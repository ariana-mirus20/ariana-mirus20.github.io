            <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence? </h2>
            <p> Emotional intelligence (EQ) - being aware of your emotions as well as the emotions of others
                <ul>
                    <li> Self-awareness</li>
                    <li>Self-regulation</li>
                    <li> Social skills
                    </li>
                    <li> Empathy</li>
                    <li>  Internal motivation</li>
                </ul>
            
            The first step is being mindful of your own emotions.

                <h2> How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p> EQ has to do with how you relate, reflect and react to others and to yourself. 
                    IQ, on the other hand, is a more structured way of defining your intelligence. 
                    Cognitive intelligence is how you work through and achieve various outcomes within a standardized test.
                </p>
                </div>

             <div> 
                    <h2> Why is it important? </h2>
                    <p> It is important to understand both concepts and to see how they relate to each other but also how they are different. 
                        EQ & IQ are components of the whole person and to measure someone’s intelligence based on only one of these factors 
                        would be unfair. There will be areas where you are more competent than others and that is ok. </p>

                        <p>Where EQ plays a role in your personal or professional life is that it will allow you to understand not only your emotions but the emotions of others when you are interacting, listening or solving problems. By working on your EQ skills you will be in a better position to negotiate, resolve conflict and come to resolutions that are more beneficial to all parties. Being a human being you are always working with other human beings. This isn’t a ‘me’ game. As you explore and work through your own EQ you will become a better communicator and problem solver overall.
                        </p>
