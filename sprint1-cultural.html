            <h4> Gather evidence to identify what your personal values are. 
                The reflection gets you to examine and identify who you are at this point, 
                this involves self-evaluation and seeking feedback from two or three trusted friends, 
                family, whanau, colleagues. This allows you to compare how you see yourself, with how others see you. </h4>
            <p> What I value personally:
                <ul>
                    <li> Time - showing up when required but also having boundaries when necessary</li>
                    <li> Kindness </li>
                    <li> Coming to the table calmly in conflict (I will also do my best to avoid conflict at all costs)</li>
                    <li> Love </li>
                    <li> Being present in conversation </li>
                    <li> Family time with good food!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            </div>

            <div> 
                <h4> Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. 
                    Evidence might include: personality or skills/capability assessment tools like 
                    Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples </h4>
                <p> My strengths are in my ability to relate to others, patience, empathy, ability to teach, organization and determination.</p>
                <p> Areas that I need to develop are my big picture thinking/plan of attack - I need to work more on breaking things down into
                    bite sized chuncks. Boundaries with my self and my time. And taking things personally - this is something that I have flagged
                    and have been working on for YEARS but it will always be a WIP.
