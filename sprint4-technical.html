                        <p> 
                            I was working on a problem where all the words in this problem had to have capital letters at the beginning of the words. 
                            Seems simple enough, so I thought. What I wanted to do was separate the first letter from the word, run it through a program 
                            that would capitalize the letter and then ask the program to add the letter back to the beginning of the word. 
                            I tried various things, I researched, I youtubed and typed in various code and nothing did anything no matter what I did.  
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            How did I solve this problem? Found out that the request I had written at the beginning of my code - a basic command 
                            that helped pass one of the test points - NEEDED TO BE REMOVED as my code was stopping after it went through that first command. 
                            Sort of like how new zealand plugs work, you can have everything plugged in the correct way with all the right dongles, your media 
                            system is ready to go… but if you don’t flip the switch at the wall no power is going to come through your system *face palm*

                            <p> Googling, talking with a friend, talking out loud, drawing in my note book. Frustrated and defeated and even more frustrated once I found out what the issue was.

                            <h3> What did you learn going through this experience?</h3>
                            <p> 
                                That I need to really take the time to READ what I am doing and go through a mental check of all the small things first to make sure they are doing what I need them to do. 
                                I found myself using the answer sections a lot and relying on the code that was written for me to pass the tests at the end. I am finding that I am at a point where 
                                somethings are not coming together the way they should in my brain and that I think generally I just need more practice to make something work. 
                                I also didn’t take the advice straight off the bat at the beginning of this challenge to really think and write down what I wanted to achieve before attempting the code. 
                                Looking back I can see where I went wrong and where I have some serious gaps. Right now I don’t know if I can do this fully but I am going to keep trying.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I need to spend more time planning and thinking before taking action. I have really thrown myself into these challenges because I know technically I am behind but I did lose site of actually 
                                thinking about what I was trying to achieve. I reckon if I took more planning time I would have been able to look at my work and seen what areas I needed to do a bit of extra research 
                                in before attempting the problem.

                            <h3> How confident do you feel using the problem solving techniques and processes?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I feel more confident after having a week of really having to use them but I need to put more of them into my practice. Before you bake a cake you make sure you have all the ingredients,
                                and if not, you check to see if you have any suitable subsitutes before going to the shop. What tricks do I have up my sleeve before, what can I try or test before doing a google? I need to also do more
                                writing of my pseudocode out instead of just talking to myself in my head.
