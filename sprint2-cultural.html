            <h3> What is your long term goal and or career pathway? </h3>
            <p> I want to have a better understanding of coding and the general tech industry. 
                I want to be able to open up new work opportunities for myself which could allow me to work 
                remotely or move out of the big city. 
                At the moment I have an interest in UX design and I am looking forward to discovering more about this.

            <div> 
                <h3> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </h3>
                <p> Definitely my technical skills. 
                    I am really enjoying this program but I am finding myself a bit slow with certain elements. 
                    I know I will get faster as I get more confident and understand the process better but it’s just a 
                    bit frustrating when you see the time slipping away from you. 
                    I am however not frustrated with my learning speed as I know I will understand the concepts.
                    I’d like to develop my negotiating skills further as well.
                </p>
                </div>

             <div> 
                    <h3> A description of your own strengths and limitations </h3>
                    <p> Definitely my technical skills. 
                        I am a very empathetic person naturally and I am also patient. 
                        This makes me a great teacher and trainer (when I know what I am teaching). 
                        I know that sometimes I can get bogged down with trying to understand the 
                        concepts of things before diving into them. Not wanting to jump before I am ready. 
                        But what I am finding so far in this course is that my time spent on understanding 
                        something vs doing isn’t quite adding up. This next week I will need to work more on my 
                        time management skills and perhaps another way to digest the material and also get enough practice time in.
                        
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div> 
                    <h3> Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
                        This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely 
                        with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. </h3>

                    <p> I need to make sure that I am making time at the beginning and end of the day to write down my 
                        goals/objectives and reflect on them. I also need to make more use out of timers and toggl and 
                        be very strict with myself once the time is up. I am excited to get to know and work with my cohort 
                        and teaching staff of EDA. I know that I will learn so much more again by being around others. 
                        I naturally work well in teams and I am happy to delegate workload but I will have to make sure that 
                        I am not overstepping at any point as I work with others.
                        
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div> 
                    <h3> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. </h3>
                        
                    <p> Firstly work on the problem, take a short break or a walk. 
                        Break down the problem into small bits and see if you can work through anything 
                        first before seeking further assistance. What I’ve been finding helpful for me the last 
                        couple of days is when I am taking a mental break writing down the questions I have for 
                        the next thing or questions I have about a concept I don’t quite understand. 
                        Then I go and see if I can google or youtube something that will help. 
                        If not, ask for some help on slack or get in touch with my facilitator. 
                        
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div> 
                    <h3> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team </h3>
                        
                    <p> <ul>
                        <li>To be checked on.</li>
                        <li> To be questioned when things aren’t done or are not done to standard.</li>
                        <li> To be guided.</li>
                        <li> To be pushed.</li>
                    </ul>   
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div> 
                    <h3> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in. </h3>
                        
                    <p> For me, because I do not have personal commitments the same way as others do I am 
                        finding this challenging because I feel like I have “all the time in the world”. 
                        But I need to rethink this because my time is valuable whether I am doing my studies, 
                        reading a book or watching my favourite tv show. I need to carve out better time slots.
                        What I need to do is re-carve out my time in a schedule/my google calendar and stick with it.
